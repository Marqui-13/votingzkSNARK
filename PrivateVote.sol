//This PrivateVote contract allows users to submit a commitment (hash of their vote), and then later reveal their vote along with a zkSNARK proof that their revealed vote matches their original commitment. The contract uses an external verifier contract to perform the zkSNARK verification.

//Note that this implementation assumes a binary choice vote (NUM_CHOICES = 2), but the contract could be modified to support more choices. Also note that this implementation is just a simple example and is not intended for production use. A real implementation would likely need to include additional security measures and auditing.
